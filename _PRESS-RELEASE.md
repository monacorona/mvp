There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > trippy is a travel map-app where users can pin places they've been, places they'd love to see, and places they miss and can't wait to see again!

## Sub-Heading ##
  > an app for wanderlusters & anyone who longs for adventure and can't wait to escape the motonony of life.

## Summary ##
  > trippy is an app that allows the user access to a map where they can pin their current location, places they've seen and places they'd like to visit. it also provides the user ability to enter in travel dates---whether as a journaled past past, or a future date indicating future plans to travel. it even allows a wanderluster to note everything they would like to do, see, or eat at their desired destination.

## Problem ##
  > there are many of us who would love to travel, but don't necessarily note when we can fit that into our future and fit in all the places we want to see. despite all these desires for travel and adventure, life tends to suck us back in and we forget all about our plans to take a break and see the world.

## Solution ##
  > trippy provides a trippy (pun may be intended) solution to the aforementioned problem by allowing users to keep track of all their future plans for travelling, and also allows you to keep track of all the places you've seen in the past. it helps you plan your next trip, and reminds you of what you loved during your last trip.

## Quote from You ##
  > 'need a break? get lost. (on an adventure)'

## How to Get Started ##
  > all it takes is a computer and access to the internet! just go onto our website and immediately start using the app! (future plans for user authentication in progress)

## Customer Quote ##
  > "trippy is better than any travel journal i could buy. it keeps track of all my trips, past and planned."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > need a vacation? just head to our page and start using trippy now!
